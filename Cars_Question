We have reset the /home/bob/playbooks/playbook.yaml playbook. Its printing some personal information of an employee. We would like to move the car_model, country_name and title values to the respective variables, and these variables should be defined at the play level.


Add three new variables named car_model, country_name and title under the play and move the values over there. Use these variables within the task to remove the hardcoded values.
